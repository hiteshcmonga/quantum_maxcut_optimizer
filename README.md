# Hybrid Max-Cut solver
A hybrid classicalâ€“quantum solver for the Max-Cut problem.
Key features:
- Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) via Qiskit
- Classical randomized baseline for Max-Cut
- Modular architecture suitable for API deployment and CI pipelines
- Metric and visualization-based comparison

---

## Background

The Max-Cut problem aims to partition the nodes of a graph into two sets such that the number (or weight) of edges between the sets is maximized.

This project provides:
- A classical approximation using randomized greedy partitioning
- A quantum-based solution using QAOA
- Comparative analysis via visualizations and numerical metrics
- A codebase organized for scalability into web apps, APIs, and cloud platforms
